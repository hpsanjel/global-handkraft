# Global Handcrafts AS: Project Scope and Product Vision

Live at [handcraftsglobal.com](https://www.handcraftsglobal.com).

## 0. Implementation Status

This section reflects what is actually built in the codebase today, as opposed to the vision/roadmap content in the rest of this document. Sections below are otherwise written as target scope; where an item is already live, it's noted inline as **(Implemented)**.

### Live today

**Storefront**
- Home, Shop with category/filter browsing, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, Account, Contact, FAQ, About, Privacy, Terms, Shipping, Returns pages
- Product variants (price/size/stock per color and size combination) and paid add-ons
- Slide-in cart drawer, coupon code entry at checkout, site-wide active-coupon promo popup
- Currency switcher with live exchange rates (NOK/EUR/USD)
- Zone-based international pricing: admin-configurable markup applied automatically by shipping country (`/admin/settings/pricing-zones`)
- Newsletter signup, cookie/GDPR notice, WhatsApp contact button
- Dynamic Open Graph image generation, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`

**Checkout & payments**
- Stripe Checkout and Vipps ePayment API, buyer's choice at checkout, both webhook-driven order creation (Vipps needs `VIPPS_*` credentials configured before it's selectable; see Getting Started in the README)
- Live shipping rate quotes via Bring (Posten Norge) and PostNord, admin-configurable shipping zones and free-shipping thresholds
- Per-country VAT rates
- Coupon engine: percentage discount, free shipping, expiry, minimum cart-value requirement, global and per-customer usage caps

**Orders & documents**
- Full order status lifecycle (Pending, Paid, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled, Refunded) with a status-history timeline and a customer email sent on every transition
- PDF generation (`@react-pdf/renderer`) for invoices, receipts, packing lists, customs invoices, gift receipts, return cards, shipping summaries, and order summaries, with barcodes (`bwip-js`), QR codes, and sequential document numbering
- Customer-facing order history with document downloads

**Custom orders (Mandap/Temple builds)**
- Customer-submitted custom order inquiries with dimensions, material, budget range, and reference images
- Dedicated admin Custom Orders dashboard (`/admin/custom-requests`), segregated from the regular Orders view
- Threaded messaging between customer and admin with unread indicators and rich-text formatting
- Live chat layered on the thread: Supabase Realtime private channels deliver new messages instantly, plus online-presence and typing indicators (`components/mandap-inquiry-thread.tsx`), and a live new/pending count badge in the admin sidebar (`components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`, `lib/realtime-broadcast.ts`)
- Admin quoting workflow: request status (Pending/Accepted/Declined/Paid), quoted price, and a manually-entered Stripe payment link — no in-app deposit/balance split or pro forma invoicing at this time

**Accounts**
- Supabase email/password authentication; admin role via email allow-list (`ADMIN_EMAILS`) or user metadata
- Customer account area: order history, addresses, custom-request threads, profile
- GDPR self-service data export and account-deletion request flow (with admin notification and a 30-day manual-processing note for bookkeeping retention)

**Admin dashboard**
- Live overview stats
- Sales reporting dashboard (`/admin/reports`): date-range trend chart, revenue/refunds summary, country breakdown, CSV export
- Products CRUD with variant/add-on management, automatic slug generation, and image upload to Supabase Storage
- Categories CRUD
- Orders management, status control, and document generation
- Coupons CRUD
- Custom Orders section (`/admin/custom-requests`), segregated from the Orders dashboard: mandap/temple inquiry management with threaded messaging and payment status control
- Shipping zone and rate configuration
- Pricing zone configuration for international markup

**Transactional email (Resend)**
- Order confirmation (with optional PDF receipt attached), order status updates, custom-inquiry admin notifications and customer replies, payment-status updates, account-deletion admin alerts

**Reviews & ratings**
- Public review submission per product (name, optional email, 1-5 star rating, title, comment), held as pending until an admin approves it
- Admin moderation queue (`/admin/reviews`) with pending/approved/all filters, approve/unapprove, and delete
- Approved reviews display on the product page with an aggregate star rating and count, kept in sync automatically (`Product.rating`/`reviewCount` recompute from approved reviews on every moderation action), plus Schema.org `AggregateRating` structured data

**Testimonials**
- Admin-managed homepage testimonials (`/admin/testimonials`): create/edit/delete, star rating, drag-to-reorder, show/hide toggle, and customer photo upload to Supabase Storage
- Replaces the previously hardcoded testimonial array; the homepage now fetches active testimonials live

**Security and data access**
- Row Level Security enabled with a deny-all policy set on every Prisma-managed table (`supabase/migrations/20260813020000_enable_rls_all_tables.sql`), closing Supabase's auto-exposed PostgREST Data API to the `anon`/`authenticated` roles; the app itself is unaffected since Prisma connects with a `BYPASSRLS` role
- Realtime Authorization policies (`supabase/migrations/20260813030000_realtime_authorization_mandap_inquiries.sql`) scope the live-chat private channels so only the inquiry's own customer (matched by email) or an admin can join an `inquiry:<id>` channel, and only admins can join the `admin:custom-requests` badge channel
- Storage bucket policies audited and trimmed (`supabase/migrations/20260813040000_drop_products_bucket_open_policies.sql`) to remove unauthenticated list/upload access left on the `products` bucket; all uploads go through the service-role client, matching the other buckets
